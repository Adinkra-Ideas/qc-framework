 * OTHER CREDITS:
*
* This is the normal smoothscale method, based on Imlib2's smoothscale.
*
* Originally I took the algorithm used in NetPBM and Qt and added MMX/3dnow
* optimizations. It ran in about 1/2 the time as Qt. Then I ported Imlib's
* C algorithm and it ran at about the same speed as my MMX optimized one...
* Finally I ported Imlib's MMX version and it ran in less than half the
* time as my MMX algorithm, (taking only a quarter of the time Qt does).
* After further optimization it seems to run at around 1/6th.
*
* Changes include formatting, namespaces and other C 'ings, removal of old
* #ifdef'ed code, and removal of unneeded border calculation code.
*
* Imlib2 is (C) Carsten Haitzler and various contributors. The MMX code
* is by Willem Monsuwe <willem@stack.nl>. All other modifications are
* (C) Daniel M. Duley.

 and conversions to other media types.

 "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or

 Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a

 copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work

 (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

 "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object

 form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

 editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications

 represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes

 of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

 separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,

 the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

 "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

 the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

 to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

 submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner

 or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of

 the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

 means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

 to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to

 "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity

 on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

 subsequently incorporated within the Work.

 Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

 this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

 worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable

 copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

 publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the

 Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

 Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

 this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

 worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable

 (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

 use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

 where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable

 by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their

 Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)

 with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You

 institute patent litigation against any entity (including a

 cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work

 or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct

 or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses

 granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate

 as of the date such litigation is filed.

 Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

 Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without

 modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

 meet the following conditions:

 (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or

 Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

 (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices

 stating that You changed the files; and

 (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

 that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and

 attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,

 excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of

 the Derivative Works; and

 (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its

 distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

 include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained

 within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not

 pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one

 of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed

 as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

 documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,

 within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and

 wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents

 of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

 do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution

 notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

 or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided

 that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed

 as modifying the License.

 You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and

 may provide additional or different license terms and conditions

 for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

 for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

 reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with

 the conditions stated in this License.

 Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,

 any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work

 by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

 this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

 Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify

 the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed

 with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

 Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade

 names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

 except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the

 origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

 Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or

 agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each

 Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

 WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or

 implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions

 of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A

 PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the

 appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any

 risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

 Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,

 whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,

 unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly

 negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be

 liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,

 incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a

 result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

 Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,

 work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all

 other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor

 has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

 Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing

 the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

 and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,

 or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this

 License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only

 on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf

 of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,

 defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability

 incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason

 of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
